# Speech-to-Speech Streaming Application

## Overview
This project is a **Speech-to-Speech Streaming Application** that allows users to:
1. Upload a video file containing audio.
2. Extract the audio from the video.
3. Transcribe the extracted audio.
4. Translate the transcription into a selected target language.
5. Generate audio for the translated text.
6. Merge the generated audio back with the original video to produce a new video file with the translated audio.

The application combines frontend and backend components to streamline the process, leveraging powerful tools and libraries like React, Flask, FFmpeg, gTTS, and Google Translator API.

## Features
### Frontend:
- **File Upload**: Users can upload a video file directly from their device.
- **Language Selection**: A dropdown menu lets users choose the target language for translation.
- **Video Preview**: Uploaded videos can be previewed on the UI.
- **Dynamic Status Updates**: The interface provides updates during audio extraction, transcription, translation, and merging processes.
- **Generated Outputs**: The app displays transcriptions, translations, and generated audio for review.

### Backend:
- **Audio Extraction**: Uses FFmpeg to extract audio from uploaded videos.
- **Audio Preprocessing**: Removes silence and optimizes audio for transcription accuracy.
- **Transcription**: Transcribes the extracted audio using Google Speech Recognition.
- **Translation**: Translates the transcription into the target language using Google Translator.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Converts the translated text into audio using gTTS.
- **Audio-Video Merging**: Merges the generated audio with the original video using FFmpeg.
